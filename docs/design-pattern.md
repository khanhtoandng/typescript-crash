# DESIGN PATTERN

1. ClassName: capital
2. Hiding functionality: private modifier
3. Duplicate code: one possible solution
4. Restric access with interface
5. implements to help TS put errors in correct location

6. Inheritance vs Composition: Making use of another object, which is usually assigned to an instance variable - and delegating some specific operation to it

7. REST convention: resources based URLs: nouns
